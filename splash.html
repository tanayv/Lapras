			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Lapras is a web robot that utilizes Capital One's Nessie Hackathon API, and emulates interactions that can be made with personal bankers. Lapras can make queries to filter transaction activity between a set time frame, and make predictions based on spending patterns.

			<h1>How we built it</h1>
			<p>Lapras is powered by PHP. The frontend was designed in HTML and CSS, which was then embedded into the PHP backend. Transitions often utilize JavaScript. All graphic elements, including icons and sprites have been designed on Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and After Effects.
			<br><br><br>
			Building a web robot makes us enter the broad realm of Natural Language Processing. Making a script understand what the user desires from just a string is a difficult parameter to base your script upon. Nonetheless, we used keyword searches and identified ways to implement features that we recognized were essential to making this finance bot.</p>
